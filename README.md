### Hi there 👋

- 💻 I'm a full stack developer, specialized in the web development ecosystem.
- 💼 I currently do full stack development (Micro Frontends) at [Storable](https://www.storable.com/products/access-control/) on their cloud-based Access Control solution for Storage Facilities.  Previously, I was at:
    - [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/), a product analytics startup, for UI / UX development across the entire platform
    - [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/), for feature development and experimentation for two applications centered around personal investing.
- 🏔️ Fun fact: I love fly fishing and the great outdoors.
- 📫 How to reach me: see my LinkedIn in the left sidebar.
